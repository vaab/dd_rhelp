Version 0.1.2
	- IMPROVEMENT : will check the log file destination for sane conditions and will try some other locations if not.
	- IMPROVEMENT : will manage max_err parameter to avoid creating to much chunks.
	- More and better information displayed at 'info' time.
Version 0.1.0
        - INSTALL : No more ./configure && make && make install ... all detection were done at runtime anyway
        - UPDATE : updated libs provided in dd_rhelp
        - UPDATE : finally compatible with recent tail/head "-n" arguments
        - Added some sanity tests.
        - TEST : Started to create dd_rhelp.test which unit tests dd_rhelp.
Version 0.0.6
        - Better error report
        - BUGFIX :
        - Strange behavior when you had 1 segments in the beginning
        - MacOS X bugfixes
Version 0.0.5
        - BUGFIX : 
        - Strange behavior when you had 2 segments in the beginning
        - Clean log file of caracters "0d" before reading it. This messed around
          with wc (not sure), or bc.
Version 0.0.4
	- Automatic detection of all programs is now done at runtime rather
        than at configure time.
Version 0.0.3
        - Better detection and information about EOF.
        - Faster and cleaner than 0.0.2
Version 0.0.2
	- Check version of dd_rescue, and try to find the good one (>=1.03)
	- dd_rhelp now writes a summary of its computation in log, allowing
	   faster loading times.
	- bar size is better ajusted and is counted in lines.
Version 0.0.1
	- work without knowing when the file ends (usefull for some /dev/*)
	- ANSI bar showing advancement of dd_rescue
	- Auto-manage dd_rescue start and stop parameters
	- Runs until all disc is rescued
	- Can be Killed/Ctrl-C... will resume its job the next time it is run.
	- feeds it self on the normal dd_rescue log file and maintain it. So
            it can resume on normal dd_rescue log created without dd_rhelp.
