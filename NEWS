0.2.0
-----

    - new: macosx support will use BSD sed and BSD stat
    - new: main algo is somewhat cleverer than before by going first
      forward then backwards and choosing a bias to favor forward
      dd_rescueing which is often much quicker.
    - new: big efforts on the testing bed for dd_rhelp.
    - imp: efforts to add some consistency checks all around.
    - imp: some effort to cache some values results in some soft speed
      ameliorations.
    - fix: handfull of little bugs where fixed.
    - fix: correctly handle strange behavior where EINVAL is sent in
      place of EOF

0.1.2
-----

    - new: will check the log file destination for sane conditions
      and will try some other locations if not.
    - new: will manage max_err parameter to avoid creating to much
      chunks.
    - new: more and better information displayed at 'info' time.
    - new: added some sanity tests.
    - new: new dd_rhelp.test which unit-tests dd_rhelp.
    - pkg: no more ./configure && make && make install ... all
      detection were done at runtime anyway
    - imp: updated libs provided in dd_rhelp
    - imp: finally compatible with recent tail/head "-n" arguments

0.0.6
-----

    - imp: better error report
    - fix: strange behavior when you had 1 segments in the beginning
    - fix: MacOS X bugfixes

0.0.5
-----

    - fix: strange behavior when you had 2 segments in the beginning
    - fix: clean log file of caracters "0d" before reading it. This messed
      around with wc (not sure), or bc.
    - new: automatic detection of all programs is now done at runtime rather
    than at configure time.
    - imp: better detection and information about EOF.
    - imp: faster and cleaner than 0.0.2

0.0.2
-----

    - new: check version of dd_rescue, and try to find the good one (>=1.03)
    - new: dd_rhelp now writes a summary of its computation in log, allowing
      faster loading times.
    - imp: bar size is ajusted and is counted in lines.
    - new: work without knowing when the file ends (usefull for some /dev/*)
    - new: ANSI bar showing advancement of dd_rescue
    - new: auto-manage dd_rescue start and stop parameters
    - new: Runs until all disk is rescued
    - new: Can be Killed/Ctrl-C... will resume its job the next time it is run.
    - new: feeds it self on the normal dd_rescue log file and maintain it. So
      it can resume on normal dd_rescue log created without dd_rhelp.
