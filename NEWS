Version 0.0.2
	- Check version of dd_rescue, and try to find the good one (>=1.03)
	- dd_rhelp now writes a summary of its computation in log, allowing
	   faster loading times.
	- bar size is better ajusted and is counted in lines.
Version 0.0.1
	- work without knowing when the file ends (usefull for some /dev/*)
	- ANSI bar showing advancement of dd_rescue
	- Auto-manage dd_rescue start and stop parameters
	- Runs until all disc is rescued
	- Can be Killed/Ctrl-C... will resume its job the next time it is run.
	- feeds it self on the normal dd_rescue log file and maintain it. So
            it can resume on normal dd_rescue log created without dd_rhelp.
