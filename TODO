  x Add a feature that if a log file is not found and the dest file has data throws an error or a warning... or something

  x - close parts should be joined by testing gaps between them...
  x - BUG : show_bar doesn't correctly draw end of bar when a correct EOF is
 found. (done ?)
  x - found which is the correct EOF in log. (done ?)
  x - Tests and ensures that nb_err is greater than 1.
  x - First time it is launched, checks right and left limits of chunks.
  x - Make a estimation time of end. Worse and good.
  x - Test if dd_rescue is the good version : the one that makes a summary 
 even in maxerr mode (partly done...)
  x - less but clearer output if possible (ansi color ?)
  x - Real handling of options... for max_err min_bs max_bs, the log_file 
 source... etc ...
  x - Much cleaner code.
  x - Better internal Map, with dd_rescued byte, error bytes, clean bytes...
